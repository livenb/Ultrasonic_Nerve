# Ultrasound Nerve Segmentation
This is my first deep learning project, which is from kaggle
[Ultrasound Nerve Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation) competition. However, the competition have already finished when i stared doing this. So there is no real way to verify my result on kaggle. The topic is interesting and challenge, i decide to carry and learn to build convolutional neural networks.
