    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we were NOT given videos for this Kaggle challenge, \n",
    "only images from those videos.  Furthermore, we've been told that the images\n",
    "for each patient are unordered. Therefore, one cannot just concatenate all \n",
    "the images together to easily reconstruct a video.\n",
    "\n",
    "To to rectify this, this script attempts to create a reasonable reconstruction\n",
    "of a patient's ultrasound video. It creates an animated GIF after finding\n",
    "a sensible order for the patient's images.  The ordering assumes that\n",
    "changes between adjacent frames in a video are generally smaller than\n",
    "changes between randomly selected frames. Therefore, finding a sequence\n",
    "that minimize the sum of changes between frames should approximate the\n",
    "original video. \n",

    "The reconstruction also includes a red outline surrounding any nerve tissue, \n",
